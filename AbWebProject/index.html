		<h2>NEUTON STARS</h2>
		<p>First lets learn a bit about 'WHITE DWARFS'. These are stars in the final stages of their evolution, with original masses that were less than about 8 solar masses. After the nuclear reactions that provided the star with energy run out of fuel, star becomes unstable, swells to become a red giant, and eventually throws off its outer layer. The remaining core then cools and contracts gravitationally until its atoms collapse into nuclei and electrons get packed closely together. A typical white dwarf has a mass about two-thirds that of the sun, but is only about the size of the Earth. Hence, it's pretty dense.</p>
		<p>After a cerain period of time, the electron mass exerts enough pressure to stop the gravitational contraction. The electrons in the highest states radiate energy and the star becomes dimmer and dimmer with time. In a few billion years, it ceases to radiate at all, and becomes a 'black dwarf', which is a dead lump of matter.</p>
		<p>A star too heavy to follow the evolutionary path to become a white dwarf, has a different fate. The large mass of such a star causes it to collapse abruptly when out of fuel, and then to explode violently. The explosion flings into space most of the star's mass. An event of this kind is called a 'SUPERNOVA'. It is a brilliant times brighter than the original star ever was. </p>
		<p>What is left after a supernova explosion maybe a remnant whose mass is greater than 1.4 times the mass of the sun. This star contracts gravitationally and its electrons become more and more energetic. After electrons become sufficiently energetic, the electrons react with protons to form neutrons. At this point the density of this star is about 20 times that of a white dwarf. After this point, neutrons are produced until most of the electrons and protons are used up. The neutrons end up as a degenerate gas, and their pressure supports the star against further gravitational shrinkage. The star, hence formed, at this point, is known as a 'NEUTRON STAR'.</p>

		<h2>Calculate your weight on Mars:</h2>
		<p>Now just to be clear, we're not actually going to take you to MARS & determine your weight over there, you know, with a weighing scale and everything. We're only going to use a simple formula to determine how much you'd weigh, if you were to be on Mars.</p>
		<p>ALL OF THIS IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE ON EARTH ONLY!</p>
