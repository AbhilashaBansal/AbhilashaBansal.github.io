        <p>The smash is the most direct and lethal way to gain a point when playing badminton. The smash also is a stroke that places the greatest demand in terms of physical requirement and mental precision. It is surely frustrating that, while you’ve given all your effort to ensure that you can gain that point from your smash, but in the end, the outcome is not what you expected it to be, and thus, a waste of effort. </p>

        <p>In the summer of 1988, a 16-year-old from the small city of Monzon, Spain experienced her first taste of pro-tennis success when she captured the singles and doubles titles at a tournament in Sofia.

The historic tournament was due to celebrate its 50th anniversary later this year.

        <p>Despite being repeatedly linked to new attackers ahead of the summer transfer window, the one area that Manchester United seemingly need to improve is their defence. The Red Devils have had no problem finding the back of the net since the restart, scoring 12 goals in their last four games, but defensive lapses are still there to be exploited.
